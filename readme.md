# 🛡️ The Path to Valhalla

**Third-person 3D survival RPG** set in a dark, frozen Nordic world.  
Your goal is to survive, prove your worth to the gods, and earn your place in **Valhalla** – the hall of fallen warriors.

---

## 📖 Game Overview

> *The Path to Valhalla* is a 3D survival game with story elements.  
> The player takes on the role of a Viking struggling to survive in a cold, hostile world inspired by Norse mythology.  
> The ultimate goal is to gain glory and ascend to Valhalla — the eternal paradise of warriors.

Throughout your journey, you will encounter:
- various types of enemies and powerful bosses,  
- neutral and friendly NPCs,  
- diverse, atmospheric locations full of secrets and rewards.  

To survive, you must gather food, craft or find healing items, upgrade your equipment, and improve your character’s skills.  
Death sends your soul to **Helheim**, the realm of the goddess Hel — a fate no true warrior desires.
